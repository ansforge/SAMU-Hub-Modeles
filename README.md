## Model generation
Based on [AsyncAPI's Modelina](https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina), this generates the data class based on the AsyncAPI schemas.

We first use the Oxygen XML Editor *XSD to JSON Schema Converter* to generate a json-schema [cisu.json](./cisu.json).

Then we embed it in the *components/schemas* section of the AsyncAPI descriptor [hubsante.asyncapi.yaml](./hubsante.asyncapi.yaml).

The npm script below will use the AsyncAPI descriptor as a source for the *Modelina* generator.

### Install
Once in this folder, run `npm i`

### Run
```
# To build the models in the `generated/` folder
npm run generate

# To build the models and copy them to the Hub Sant√©
npm run generate4Hub
```
